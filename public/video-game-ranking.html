<h1>Best Games of 2023 According to Erik</h1>

<h2>My top 3 video games of this year</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Baldur's Gate 3</h3>

<p>Amazing story, characters, gameplay. Just the perfect package with tons of content and replayability.</p>

<h3>Cyberpunk 2077</h3>

<p>The new update has been amazing and it's awesome jumping back into V's story in Night City.</p>

<h3>Tears of the Kingdom</h3>

<p>Builds on everything that BOTW did. The crafting is super fun and exloration is very rewarding.</p>
